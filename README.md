## What is Threatibox?

ThreatBox is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to expiriment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

## Progress

So far, a very basic framework has been implemented. Almost all key-features have been added, but the webpage is currently very user unfriendly. In the next update for this, I'd have added some more css to make it easier to use. But as it stands, the user can play and mute each layer individualy, as well as pause the song and stop/play every layer at once. Currently, it's basically crappy Incredibox minus any visuals; and that's exactly what I was aiming for with my first commit. 

## TODO:

Descending in priority:

1. Smooth auto-looping
2. Restarting the song when no layers are active
3. Individual layer and master volume settings
4. Pre-picking layers to begin with before the song begins
5. Timing feature, to only allow layers to be added on-beat
6. Recording feature
7. Exporting recordings
8. Other region threat themes
9. Styling and detailing
    - Audio visualizer
    - Song progress bar
10. Misc. and not totally necessary stuff
    - Modded region threat themes?
    - Secret combinations?
    - Auto play feature?
