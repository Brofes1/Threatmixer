# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Development progress*

The Preservatory and Luminous Cove have been added, be sure to check those out! Me and ECSP are still working on making new icons, but I'll still push out minor updates like bugfixes or whatnot. This likely marks the last significant update of the year, and I am still amazed at what I was able to accomplish since Summer of this year. I can't wait to see what 2025 will bring for this project! Thank you shwoing interest in Threatmixer, and happy new year!
