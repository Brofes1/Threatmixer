# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Development progress*

Watcher regions have been added!! Also, a new button leading to a feedback form has been added to the home screen. Defenitely use that if you have anything you'd like to suggest or saw about the webpage. No emails will be collected from anyone taking the form, and all submissions are anonymous. Look forward to more features and visual improvements in the future.
