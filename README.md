# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Development progress*

It's about time I did some organization of my code. Now, adding new features should be much easier now that everthing isn't just in one file anymore. Nothing else was really changed aside from that, except for a few minor changes to how the program goes through its procedures. You can find these changes inside the main.js. Expect some more new features to begin trickling in before the next big update.

# *TO DO:*

- Fading layers
- Better UI
- More customizability
- ???
