## What is Threatmixer?

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to expiriment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

## Progress

Got a start button working, as well as more UI improvements. Now, I'm moving into some unfamiliar territory with recording audio from the page and then saving it, but I'll figure it out. Aside from that, the next push will also include all of the other threat themes being intergrated, which is actually pretty exciting for me! I'm ready to listen to something other than the same Outskirts layers over and over again lol.
