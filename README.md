# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Developement progress*

A whole bunch of modded regions have been added! Also, if you look at the favicon, you'll notice that Threatmixer has a new logo as well. It's a vulture mask with headphones, courtesy of ECSP of course. Aside from those things, minor code changes have been made which should hopefully improve the selection screen's functionality. Although the regions have been added and are ready to be used, you'll notice that there are some placeholders where the button icon should be for certain sounds (as indicated by the stop/"sqaure" icon). Me and ECSP are working to design new button icons to accomidate for all of the unique and wonderful sounds featured in some of these modded regions. Keep an eye out for when the icon update releases, and have a merry Christmas!
