# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Development progress*

Aether Ridge has been added, and I've now also begun to keep track of this webpage's versions, which you can see on the bottom right of the home screen. I have quite a few ideas as to what to add to this site in the future, but I don't want to jump into anything quite yet without every modded region having its own full set of icons. Stay tuned.

# *TODO:*

- New icons
