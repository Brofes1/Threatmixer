# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Terms of Use*

As an open source project, users are free to use Threatmixer however they may please, whether that is by creating and sharing custom mixes or editing code and creating forks on the github repository. If you make something using this webpage and are to upload it to another service (particularly youtube), all that I ask is that you state that you've made that piece of media using Threatmixer, and that you provide a direct link to the webpage where it is easily visable to the general audience of your content (i.e. in the video description or a pinned comment). 

Example:
"*I made this cool mix using Threatmixer! Here's the link so you could check it out yourself:*
*(link)*"

If you wish to use any pixel art on the page for whatever purpose, please contact me or ECSP directly to ask for permission.

# *Development progress*

I'm kinda tired so I'll keep this brief. I added:
- Better mobile compatability
- More loading screen info
- Improved visualizer visuals
- Small tweaks to the selection screen

Just some more minor improvements. Expect a bunch of new songs next update though, that'll be more exciting.
