# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Development progress*

Every modded region now has a full set of button icons! Sorry that this took a little while, conceptualizing, designing, and then creating these icons is a process. Along with the modded regions, some icons for vanilla regions have been changed as well, which was just based on if I thought some sounds could be better represented with the new art we have. This update was mostly cosmetic, but now I have some more "mechanical" changes in mind for the future. I want to keep it somewhat of a suprise, but you can see some of the smaller things I plan to add in the TO DO list below.

# *TO DO:*

- Fading layers
- Better UI
- More Controls
- ???
