## What is Threatmixer?

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to expiriment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

## Progress

Added two features: Queuing recordings and a song progres bar. Just some minor things before I actually start moving onto detailing. I also made sure to get some feedback from friends so that I know what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong. Next push will ACTUALLY be the style update this time. Expect a considerable increase in css percentage.

## TODO:

Descending in priority:

1. Styling and detailing
    - General ui improvements and decoration
2. Misc. and not totally necessary stuff
    - Modded/Custom threat themes?
    - Secret combinations?
    - Auto play feature?
    - Responsive design?
    - Speed up/slow down functionality?
