# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to experiment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Development progress*

A new region has been added, and a couple of bugfixes have been done to the selection screen. You'll also notice the new button on the selection screen as well. I added a toggle to the previews since I found it kinda annoying to accidently go over a region button and then have to hear the preview for a second. Hopefully someone finds it useful. Also, look out for a new spinning face on the loading screen. That's about it for this update, expect some more tidying up in the next couple of updates as well.

# *TO DO*
