# *What is Threatmixer?*

Threatmixer is a webpage which will allow the user to play with and mix the various threat themes from the game Rain World. I was heavily inspired by Incredibox, a game where you take various sound elements and mash them together to make your own music. Thinking about how fun it was to expiriment with different sound combinations in Incredibox, I thought about how cool it'd be if you could mix and match the layers of a threat theme at will, sparking the idea for this project.

# *Developement progress*

The home screen has been added with plenty of information to help users get familiar with the webpage. Along with that, plenty of other changes have been made to generally improve the site. I'm happy (and relieved) to say that I consider Threatmixer to now be in a presentable and enjoyable state, meaning it's ready for an official release!!! Changes are still to come in the future of course; me and ECSP have a logo in the works and now it's time to move on to adding modded threat themes (though when that'll actually happen, I'm not sure. I might want to take a break from this project and pursue some other things, but we'll see.) I can't give any specific times fow when I expect these changes to come, but, as akways, stay tuned if you're interested.

# *TODO:*
