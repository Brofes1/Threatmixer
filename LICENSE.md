# *Credits*

## Me
Hey, this is the creator speaking. I go by Rotwall, and I'm responsible for coding the entirity of this webpage. Everything you see inside of the files at the root directory of this page was written by me (with outside help of course, I'm not *that* much of a coding genius.)

Here's some links if you want to find out more about me or see what else I'm working on:
- [Github](https://github.com/Rotwall72)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Rotwall)

You can also find me on the Official Rain World Discord Server, my username is the same there as anywhere else.

## Contibuters
A huge thanks to ECSP for providing pixel art graphics, as well as general guidance during developemnt.

Another thank you to everyone who tested this webpage and provided feedback; those being:
- ECSP
- TheLobsterFoam
- AliKirb

I also have to give credit to Barrett Sonntag for creating a [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp), making changing the color of images a hell of a lot easier.

## Videocult
Rain World is a property of Videocult, and I am not affilated with Videocult or Akupara Games in any way. All assets inside of the threat_music and region_backgrounds folders were created by members of Videocult as well as others who worked on Rain World Downpour.

## Music
Audio files were provided by [Rawry](https://www.youtube.com/@RawryProbably) via google drive.

## Fonts
The Rodondo font (the one used as the title font for Rain World) was created by @ollywood on twitter and uploaded to [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/rodondo.font).

The Rain World menu font was recreated by DANNYY1TDM on [fontstruct](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2392353/rain-world-menu).

## Images
Region backgrounds were provided by the [official Rain World wiki](https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Official_Art).

## Code
The visualizer present in the music screen was made by following a tutorial created by [QuickCodingTuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb6C1XNqJzA) on YouTube.

# *Final Statement*
I want to give one last thank you to Videocult and all of the brilliant minds within it for making genuinely one of the most important works of art of my entire life. I've been obsessed with Rain World ever since I first beat it in 2021, and it still occupies a fast majority of my mind today. This game has been a source of inspiration for countless ideas and stories and games and what-have-you that I've been conjuring up in my head over these past few years. I don't think it'd be entirely false to say that this game has played a huge role in turning me into the person I am today. I could literally gush about everything this game has to offer for hours, but I need to keep this to a sizable paragraph. In making this project, I'm finally able to give back to this game and its community in my own unique way, and that in itself is a blessing I'll never take for granted. Again, thank you Rain World devs and to everyone who's helped and supported me along this journey. And a special thanks to *you* for taking the time to read this and checking out my project. I hope you will enjoy, or have enjoyed, this webpage as much as I did making it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
