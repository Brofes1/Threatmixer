## Videocult

Rain World is a property of Videocult, and I am not affiliated with Videocult or Akupara Games in any way. All assets inside of the threat_music and region_backgrounds folders were created by members of Videocult as well as others who worked on Rain World Downpour. All base game threat themes can be found in the official [Rain World ost](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuX1dXf1Zu0kHEc_TrwqgbKaEkWJOAqlN). Audio files were provided by [Rawry](https://www.youtube.com/@RawryProbably) via google drive. All base game region background art was provided by the [official Rain World wiki](https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Official_Art).

## Fonts
The Rodondo font (the one used as the title font for Rain World) was created by @ollywood on twitter and uploaded to [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/rodondo.font).

The Rain World menu font was recreated by DANNYY1TDM on [fontstruct](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2392353/rain-world-menu).

## Code
The visualizer present in the music screen was made by following a tutorial created by [QuickCodingTuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb6C1XNqJzA) on YouTube.

I also have to give credit to Barrett Sonntag for creating a [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp), making finding the filters to use for changing the color of images a hell of a lot easier.

# *Modded Region Credits*

(*Note:* All of the regions which are currently known to be part of the watcher dlc, which includes **Aether Ridge**, **Badlands**, **Stormy Coast**, and **Coral Caves**, are all presented on this site as they were before the release of the watcher's campaign. The soundtracks and, of course, threat themes of these regions are subject to change by the watcher team.)

A humongous thank you to Rain World's modding community for allowing their amazing work to be featured on this page.

# *Final Statement*
I want to give one last thank you to Videocult and all of the brilliant minds within it for making my most favorite video game ever, and changing how I view gaming and art as a whole. I've been obsessed with Rain World ever since I first played it in 2021, and my love for it has hardly waned since. This game has been a source of inspiration for countless stories, ideas, games and what-have-you that I've been conjuring up in my head over these past few years. I think it's safe to say that this game has played a huge role in turning me into the person I am today. In making this project, I'm finally able to give back to this game and its community in my own unique way, and that in itself is a blessing I'll never take for granted. Again, thank you Rain World devs and to everyone who's helped and supported me along this journey. And a special thanks to *you* for taking the time to read this and check out Threatmixer. I hope you will enjoy, or have enjoyed, using this webpage as much as I did making it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
