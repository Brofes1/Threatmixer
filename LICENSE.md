## Credits

# Contibuters
Thank you to ECSP for providing pixel art graphics, as well as playtesting and giving feedback. 
Thank you to thelobsterfoam for also testing earlier versions of the webpage and giving useful input.

I also have to give credit to Barrett Sonntag for creating a [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp), making changing the color of images a hell of a lot easier.

# Videocult
Rain World is a property of Videocult. All assets inside of the threat_music and region_backgrounds folders were created by members of Videocult as well as others who worked on Rain World Downpour. I own none of the assets present on the page.

# Music
Audio files were taken from [cookiecaker's repository](https://github.com/cookiecaker/Rain-World-Sounds).

# Fonts
The Rodondo font (the one used as the title font for Rain World) was created by @ollywood on twitter and uploaded to [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/rodondo.font).

The Rain World menu font was recreated by DANNYY1TDM on [fontstruct](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2392353/rain-world-menu).

# Images
Region backgrounds were taken from the [official Rain World wiki](https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Official_Art).
